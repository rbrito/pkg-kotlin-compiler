kotlin-compiler for Debian
-------------------------

The version number of the package has been changed, since Debian version
numbers can't contain a hyphen, but upstream uses them.

The hypen has been changed to a dot. As a result, the first packaged release
had a version of 1.1.2-5, which was rewritten as 1.1.2.5.
