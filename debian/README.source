kotlin-compiler for Debian
-------------------------

This package, at the time of the first packaging, does not (not even close)
conform to the Debian policy, since it is simply a repackaging of the
binaries that the upstream developers provide.

As time goes on, I intend to be replacing the parts in question with
(unpatched) libraries and programs that are already in the Debian repository
and package the other parts that are still not there, so that it can
gradually get closer and closer to being suitable for inclusion in Debian
proper.

The main reason for the package being made this way is to avoid external
package managers like SDKMAN or to avoid losing control of programs
installed manually on the system, especially when it comes time to upgrade
said programs.
